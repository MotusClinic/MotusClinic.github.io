                Osteopaths are health care professionals who use manual therapy to restore mobility to improve the function of your body systems to then optimize its self-regulation. An osteopathy appointment begins with an assessment where an in-depth history and evaluation are completed in order to find the cause of your health concern. Each treatment is specific to the person and their concern. An osteopath is able to treat a variety of health concerns including, but not limited to, musculoskeletal pain (back, neck, shoulder), headaches, jaw pain, pregnant women and pediatrics.
